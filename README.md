# Practical Machine Learning Project

# # Data Source and Background
Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. We made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).

In this repo, you will find two files containing the R code used for predictive modeling and RMarkdown compiled HTML file with the data analysis report. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the six participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. In this repo, you will find two files containing the R code used for predictive modeling and RMarkdown compiled HTML file with analysis report.
